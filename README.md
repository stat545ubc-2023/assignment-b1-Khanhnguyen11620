# STAT 545B: Assignment B1 
Author: Khanh Nguyen

**___About this project___**

This assignment covers making a function in R, documenting it, giving some examples and testing it. Our new function is called grade_letter() which can generate the grade letter (A,B,C or D) based on the input score (0-100). 

**___Files in the GitHub repository___**

There are three files:
   - assignment-b1.Rmd: This document is for creating the function according to the requirements of this assignment. The Rmd file includes markdown(content with simple text formatting) and R code chunks.
   - assignment-b1.md: This document is created when we click 'knit' in Rstudio, it will execute all of the R code chunks and create a new markdown (. md) document which includes the R code and its output.
   - README.md: This document provides context and how-to instructions for the project

**___How to run the code in this repository___**
- Firstly, you can clone this repository into your GitHub and pull the project to R.
- Secondly, you need to install required packages (if not installed yet): `tidyverse`, `testthat` to do the project. `tidyverse` includes some functions used to create our new function and `testthat` was used to test the function (there are instructions in the .Rmd file)
- After completing all the exercises in the project, you need to click 'knit' in Rstudio. It will execute all of the R code chunks and create a new markdown (. md) document which includes the R code and its output.
